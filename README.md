With Inkscape MCP, your coding agent can do everything a designer does in Inkscape — sketch and reshape paths, apply effects and filters, render LaTeX equations, generate barcodes and QR codes, convert between formats, query and rewrite document structure — through plain conversation instead of menu clicks.

Pair it with a **running Inkscape window** and the agent works alongside you — it sees what you have selected, opens property dialogs on your behalf, applies edits that appear on the canvas in real time (each one a normal undo entry you can roll back), and rasterizes its own work to inspect and refine the result. Or run it **headlessly** to batch-convert artwork, automate exports, and build pipelines around vector assets — no GUI required. The full Inkscape feature surface, including its hundreds of bundled extensions, is reachable as tool calls.

## How it works

1. The agent calls one of ten portmanteau tools — `inkscape_file`, `inkscape_vector`, `inkscape_analysis`, `inkscape_system`, `inkscape_extension`, `inkscape_gradient`, `inkscape_metadata`, `inkscape_layers`, `inkscape_animation`, or `inkscape_live` — with an `operation` string that picks the actual behavior.
2. For headless work the server dispatches through `InkscapeCliWrapper`, which builds and runs an `inkscape --actions=...` (or `--export-...`) command. For live-canvas work it talks to a running Inkscape window over D-Bus and stages SVG fragments through the clipboard.
3. Inkscape reads your input file (or the open document), runs the operation, and writes the output.
4. The server returns dimensions, file paths, validation results, or whatever the operation produces — typed and trimmed for the agent's context window.

No external network. Just the Inkscape binary, an optional running Inkscape window, and your local files.

## Getting started

> Tested with **Inkscape 1.4.4** on Ubuntu 24.04.

```bash
# 1. Install Inkscape + system headers for pycairo / pygobject
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:inkscape.dev/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install inkscape libcairo2-dev libgirepository-2.0-dev libgirepository1.0-dev \
pkg-config python3-dev xclip
# xclip stages SVG fragments for clipboard-based insert into the canvas.
# Clipboard ops auto-detect the backend. On Wayland (the Ubuntu 24.04 default)
# wl-clipboard is preferred if installed; otherwise xclip is used, which works
# because Inkscape runs as an XWayland client. Either package is sufficient.

# 2. Register with Claude Code (uvx fetches inkscape-mcp from PyPI on first run)
claude mcp add inkscape_mcp -s user -- uvx inkscape_mcp
claude mcp list | grep inkscape_mcp   # → ✓ Connected

# 3. (Re)start Inkscape so it picks up the bundled extensions
# The MCP server auto-installs its inkex extensions to
# ~/.config/inkscape/extensions/inkscape_mcp/ on first boot. Inkscape only
# scans the extensions dir at startup, so close + reopen Inkscape once.
# Verify via:
#   inkscape_system(operation="diagnostics")  → bridge.needs_restart should be false
```

That's it. Ask the agent to convert an SVG, query an object's bounding box, run a boolean union — it'll pick the right tool.

### Alternative install paths

```bash
# Plain pip into a venv
pip install inkscape-mcp

# uv into a project
uv add inkscape-mcp
```

The PyPI name is `inkscape-mcp` (hyphen). The Python import name is `inkscape_mcp` (underscore — PEP 8 / valid identifier). Both `pip install inkscape-mcp` and `pip install inkscape_mcp` resolve to the same project (PEP 503 name normalization).

### macOS and Windows: the built-in bus (no `dbus-daemon` needed)

Live control goes over D-Bus, and macOS and Windows have no session bus. The server therefore **hosts a small pure-Python bus in-process** (`embedded_bus.py`) and launches Inkscape under it — nothing extra to install. It listens only on a private `0700` unix socket (macOS) or loopback TCP (Windows).

- A hand-launched Inkscape is not on that bus; the first `inkscape_live` call starts one for you. Use `open_file` to work on a document.
- `INKSCAPE_MCP_BUS=embedded|system` forces either mode. With a real session bus (normal Linux desktop, or `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` set) the server uses it and leaves your Inkscape alone.
- **macOS limit:** GTK's macOS backend exports no `/window/N` objects, so window-scoped actions are routed to the document or app scope instead, and `document-save` is done by exporting over the file. `inkscape_live(operation="ping")` reports `window_scope: false` there.
- The launcher caps an oversized open-file limit (Inkscape 1.4.2 on macOS crashes when run extensions inherit a limit of ~1M) and adds the app bundle's `bin` to `PATH` so extensions find Python.
- Windows with MSYS2's `dbus-daemon` already installed keeps using it; the embedded bus is used otherwise.

Verified on macOS (Apple Silicon, Inkscape 1.4.2). The Windows TCP path is implemented but not yet verified on real hardware.

### Windows (MSYS2 daemon, optional)

The headless tools install and run exactly as above. The **live** bridge (`inkscape_live`) needs one extra piece: a Windows `dbus-daemon`, which isn't part of a stock Windows install. The simplest source is [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) — install it, then:

```sh
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-dbus   # provides dbus-daemon.exe; MCP auto-discovers it
```

`gdbus.exe` itself already ships with Inkscape, and the daemon's dependency DLLs are covered by Inkscape's, so MSYS2 is only the delivery vehicle for that one `dbus-daemon.exe`. If you already have one elsewhere, point `INKSCAPE_MCP_DBUS_DAEMON` at it (and `INKSCAPE_MCP_GDBUS` if `gdbus.exe` isn't found automatically).

On Windows the live bridge **launches and manages its own Inkscape instance** — a hand-launched Inkscape isn't on the bus, so have the agent `open_file` a document to work on it. Tested on Inkscape 1.4.x.

## Configuration

The Claude Code entry the install command above creates looks like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inkscape_mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["inkscape_mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Pin a non-default Inkscape with `INKSCAPE_BIN=/path/to/inkscape` in the server env; the server only falls back to searching `$PATH` when nothing pins it. Inspect from the agent via `inkscape_system(operation="diagnostics")` — its `config_sources` block reports each tracked setting's effective value alongside where it came from (`env_var`, `config_file`, `cli_flag`, `auto_detected` or `default`).

### Security

By default the server can read and write any path you give it, as before. To confine it, set a scope and, if you want, strict mode:

| Setting | Env override | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `allowed_directories: [...]` | `INKSCAPE_MCP_ALLOWED_DIRS` (path-separated) | Every path argument of every tool must resolve (symlinks followed) inside one of these. Relative paths are anchored in the first. Paths inside JSON parameters (`rasterize`'s `filename`, extension params) are checked too. |
| `security_mode: strict` | `INKSCAPE_MCP_SECURITY=strict` | Also: raw `apply_action` limited to an allowlist (no `file-*`, `export-*`, `window-*`, extensions), `execute_inkex` and `execute_extension` disabled, only stock `org.inkscape.*` extensions. Without a scope it confines to the working directory. |
| `max_file_size_mb` | — | Input files above this are refused. |

Always on, regardless of mode: action strings containing `;`, a newline or NUL are rejected (Inkscape has no escape for `;`, so one would inject extra actions); exports are written to a temporary file and moved into place only on success, so a failed run never leaves a truncated file; a timed-out Inkscape is killed together with its helper processes; and `max_concurrent_processes` is enforced.

Known limits: a path scope cannot stop an SVG you insert from *referencing* a local file (`<image href=…>`), and `execute_inkex` runs arbitrary Python in Inkscape when not in strict mode.

## Try asking your agent to…

**Editing the file you have open**

- "Recolor everything blue to red"
- "Open document properties — I can't find the DPI setting"
- "Select the pen tool so I can draw a curve"
- "Show me the XML editor"
- "Hide the snap controls bar"
- "Add a drop shadow to all the rectangles"
- "Convert this monogram to a single compound path"
- "Run a boolean union on the two selected shapes"

**Generating SVG content**

- "Drop in an isometric grid into this document"
- "Generate a calendar for the current month and paste it here"
- "Make me a 24×24 settings cog icon — currentColor stroke, round caps"

**Inspection & format conversion**

- "Export this to a 4× PNG and a print-ready PDF"
- "What's the bounding box of #logo-mark?"
- "Optimize this SVG — strip Inkscape namespace cruft"
- "List every object in the file with its type and size"

**Live-canvas workflows** (Inkscape running)

- "Read what I have selected"
- "Align these three icons horizontally with equal spacing"
- "Swap the whole palette to a warmer earth-tone scheme"
- "Add a 3-stop gradient to the rect with id `hero`"

The agent picks the right tool. It can drive over 1,000 of Inkscape's actions over D-Bus (1,083 app-scope plus 163 window-scope on Inkscape 1.4.4 — ask for the exact figure with `inkscape_live(operation="ping")`), fall back to headless CLI when the GUI isn't running, and run inkex extensions for things D-Bus doesn't cover.

## Available tools

- **`inkscape_file`** — load, save, convert (PDF/PNG/EPS/PS/…), validate, batch convert.
- **`inkscape_vector`** — 49 ops covering boolean, tracing, path simplification, optimization, alignment, layer export, geometry mutation, barcodes, LPE chains, tile clones.
- **`inkscape_analysis`** — quality scoring, statistics, object lists, layer structure.
- **`inkscape_system`** — server status, diagnostics, extension discovery and execution.
- **`inkscape_extension`** — discover and invoke any installed inkex extension (headless or on the live canvas).
- **`inkscape_gradient`** — gradient-stop manipulation; linear↔radial conversion.
- **`inkscape_metadata`** — read/write Dublin-Core RDF metadata.
- **`inkscape_layers`** — create, rename, delete, show/hide, lock and reorder layers (including nested sublayers) in an SVG file. Pure XML.
- **`inkscape_animation`** — add SMIL / CSS animation (presets, attribute, transform, motion path, colour) to elements of an SVG file.
- **`inkscape_live`** — drive the running GUI over D-Bus: live edits, paste-in-place, XML edits, `rasterize` so the agent can see the canvas (preserves undo).

## How the agent learns to use it

An agent that just installed this server doesn't know your workflow, so the server teaches it. MCP's `InitializeResult.instructions` is pushed into the client's system prompt on connect, and this server uses it to establish the working method rather than just the mechanics: **compose procedurally instead of hand-writing SVG** (place primitives, then let Inkscape align, distribute, boolean and clone them), **rasterize and actually look at the result** before declaring it done, **ask you to select** the objects you want help with, and **open the dialog or tool** you're asking about instead of describing a menu path.

Deeper material is pull-based — `resource://inkscape/mcp-workflow` (operational guide, recipes, and the Inkscape rendering pitfalls that silently ruin output), `resource://inkscape/cli-actions` (the full verb catalog), plus `prompt://inkscape/design-workflow` for the step-by-step design loop, which most clients surface as a slash command. The pushed instructions name those explicitly so the agent knows to fetch them.
