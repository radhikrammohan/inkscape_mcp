"""Bridge for invoking custom inkex extensions from the MCP.

The MCP writes a JSON spec into a shared exchange directory, fires the
extension via D-Bus, and reads a JSON result the extension writes back.
Two architectural wins over the file-edit + document-revert dance:

  1. Inkscape records each extension invocation as a single undoable command,
     so MCP-driven edits stay in the user's undo history.
  2. Provides a return channel for inspection ops — D-Bus actions have no
     way to return data, but a JSON result file does.

Layout:
  ~/.cache/inkscape_mcp/exchange/
    input.json   (MCP -> extension)
    result.json  (extension -> MCP)
    stderr.txt   (extension stderr capture, if any)

Concurrency: the filenames above are fixed, so two overlapping invocations would
trample each other — B's spec would overwrite A's input.json, and B's unlink would
delete the result A is waiting for. Per-call unique names aren't an option: the
`.noprefs` D-Bus action carries no arguments, so the plugin has no way to be told
which file to read. Instead every invocation is serialised through `BRIDGE_LOCK`,
which also guards the shared (non-thread-safe) jeepney connection.
