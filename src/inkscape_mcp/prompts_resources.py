0. `inkscape_live(operation="ping")` to confirm the bridge, then read
   `resource://inkscape/mcp-workflow` for op selection and the Inkscape rendering pitfalls.
1. Establish the target. If it is at all ambiguous which objects are in scope, ASK THE USER
   TO SELECT them on canvas, then read it back with `inkscape_live(operation="get_selection")`.
   Otherwise read context with `inspect_view`, `inspect_layers`, `inspect_element`.
2. Block out rough geometry with stable, meaningful `id`s on everything you create — ids are
   the handle for every later edit.
3. Let Inkscape do the geometry rather than computing it:
   - layout: `inkscape_vector` `align` (operation_type e.g. "top", "hcenter vcenter") and
     `distribute` ("hgap", "vgap"), `page_fit_to_selection`, `fit_canvas_to_drawing`
   - combining: `apply_boolean` (union / difference / intersection / exclusion),
     `path_combine`, `path_break_apart`, `path_inset_outset`, `stroke_to_path`
   - repetition: `clone`, `tile_clone`, `object_to_marker`, `object_to_pattern`
4. Apply effects through Inkscape: `inkscape_extension(operation="run_live", target=<id>)`
   with NO params, after selecting the target — that is the mode that sees the live document
   and selection. Also `lpe_*` for path effects.
5. RASTERIZE AND LOOK: `inkscape_live(operation="rasterize")`, then read the PNG back and
   judge it. Do not assume the SVG renders as intended — check occlusion, clipping, colour
   and filter regions visually. Iterate from what you see.
6. Offer the relevant dialog when the user would want to take over —
   `apply_action("dialog-open", payload="FillStroke" | "AlignDistribute" | "XMLEditor" | ...)`.

Every step is one undo entry, so work incrementally and let the user co-edit alongside you."""
